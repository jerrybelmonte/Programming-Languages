## Introduction
Fundamental topics in the design and implementation of programming languages. 
Programing language paradigms. Comparison of languages in type systems, data 
types, control flow, subroutines, concurrency, and exception handling.

## Objective
Study the how's and why's of programming language design and implementation 
to a much greater level of detail than is possible in lower-level courses. 
Cover essential programming language concepts like binding time, type systems, 
abstraction mechanisms, reflection, recursion, memory management, lambda 
calculus, and message passing. Also, contrast different language paradigms 
(procedural, object-oriented, functional, logic, concurrent) and complete 
programming assignments in each. Particular emphasis will be placed on the 
functional programming paradigm, and its concerns of higher-order functions 
and immutable state.

## Functional vs Imperative Programming
* Loops vs. Recursion
  - Accumulating parameter 
  - Tail call optimization
* Algebraic Datatypes
  - Products
  - Co-Products
  - Type-Recursion
* Turing Machine & Î»-Calculus
  - Theoretical foundations of imperative and functional programing paradigms
* Evaluation strategies
  - call-by-value
  - call-by-need and in particular lazy evaluation
* Programming languages comparison:
  - C: Classic imperative language
  - Haskell: Modern pure functional language

### Haskell vs C
* Basic Language Constructs in C & Haskell
  - Variables
    - Mutable/Immutable
  - Functions
    - Side effects
  - Conditionals
  - Loops
  - Recursion
* Loops vs. Recursion
  - Accumulating parameter 
  - Tail call optimization
