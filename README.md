# Principles of Programming Languages
Fundamental topics in the design and implementation of programming languages. 
Programing language paradigms. Comparison of languages in type systems, data 
types, control flow, subroutines, concurrency, and exception handling.

## Objective
Study the how's and why's of programming language design and implementation 
to a much greater level of detail than is possible in lower-level courses. 
Cover essential programming language concepts like binding time, type systems, 
abstraction mechanisms, reflection, recursion, memory management, lambda 
calculus, and message passing. Also, contrast different language paradigms 
(procedural, object-oriented, functional, logic, concurrent) and complete 
programming assignments in each. Particular emphasis will be placed on the 
functional programming paradigm, and its concerns of higher-order functions 
and immutable state.
